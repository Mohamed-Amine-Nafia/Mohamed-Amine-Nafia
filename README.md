## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a learner of the <b>ALX Front-End Web Development Program</b> with a passion for transforming ideas into beautiful, accessible, and functional websites. My journey into software engineering started because I’ve always been curious about how the websites I use are built. This curiosity turned into a passion for front-end development, where creativity meets problem-solving. Seeing how code transforms into real products inspired me to pursue this journey.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My aim is to create accessible, modern, and meaningful digital experiences that improve people’s daily lives. I want to work on projects that combine design and functionality, while learning from and contributing to the developer community.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I'm particularly interested in building responsive web apps, intuitive dashboards, and contributing to open-source projects that have real-world impact.
